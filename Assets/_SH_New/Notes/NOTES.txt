Note about Application Capabilities configured in Package.appxmanifest

If the UWP folder (which should be ignored in git ignore) is ever deleted
and recreated with a new Unity build, then that file needs to be updated
with:
  <Capabilities>
    <DeviceCapability Name="wiFiControl" />
  </Capabilities>

As we have a plugins that can use the wiFi capabilities.  (Althought at this time we are
not using this in the current version of the APP)
